# SO100 Robot Gripping and Lifting Improvements Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the comprehensive improvements made to enable the SO100 manipulator robot arm to successfully grasp and lift the cube. The robot was previously able to reach the cube but couldn't properly grip and lift it.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Contact sensors disabled** - Robot couldn't detect when it touched the object
2. **Binary gripper control** - Limited fine control for gripping
3. **Missing gripping rewards** - No specific rewards for successful grasping behavior
4. **Weak gripper actuator** - Insufficient force and stiffness for reliable gripping
5. **Limited observations** - Policy lacked gripper state and contact information

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Robot Configuration (`so_100_robot_cfg.py`)

**Contact Sensors Enabled:**
```python
activate_contact_sensors=True  # Enable contact sensors for better gripping
```

**Improved Gripper Actuator:**
```python
"gripper": ImplicitActuatorCfg(
    joint_names_expr=["Gripper"],
    effort_limit=5.0,    # Increased from 3.0 for stronger grip
    velocity_limit_sim=2.0,  # Increased from 1.5 for faster gripping
    stiffness=100.0,    # Increased from 60.0 for more reliable closing
    damping=30.0,       # Increased from 20.0 for stability
),
```

### 2. Contact Sensor Integration (`so_100_cube_lift_with_camera_env_cfg.py`)

**Added Gripper Contact Sensor:**
```python
self.scene.gripper_contact = ContactSensorCfg(
    prim_path="{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Robot/Fixed_Gripper",
    body_names=["Fixed_Gripper"],
    history_length=5,
    track_pose=True,
    filter_prim_paths_expr=["{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Object"],
    debug_vis=True,
)
```

**Continuous Gripper Control:**
```python
# Changed from BinaryJointPositionActionCfg to JointPositionActionCfg
self.actions.gripper_action = mdp.JointPositionActionCfg(
    asset_name="robot",
    joint_names=["Gripper"],
    scale=0.3,  # Smaller scale for finer control
    use_default_offset=True
)
```

### 3. Enhanced Reward Functions (`mdp/rewards.py`)

**New Gripping Rewards:**

1. **Contact Detection Reward:**
```python
def gripper_contact_reward(env, contact_threshold=0.1):
    """Reward for detecting contact between gripper and object."""
```

2. **Gripper Closing Reward:**
```python
def gripper_closing_reward(env, target_gripper_pos=0.1):
    """Reward for closing the gripper when near the object."""
```

3. **Successful Grasp Reward:**
```python
def successful_grasp_reward(env, gripper_threshold=0.2, contact_threshold=0.1):
    """Combined reward for successful grasping (gripper closed + contact detected)."""
```

### 4. Improved Observations (`mdp/observations.py`)

**New Observation Functions:**

1. **Gripper State:**
```python
def gripper_joint_state(env):
    """Get the current gripper joint state."""
```

2. **Contact Forces:**
```python
def gripper_contact_forces(env, sensor_cfg):
    """Get contact forces from the gripper contact sensor."""
```

### 5. Updated Environment Configuration (`so_100_base_env_cfg.py`)

**Enhanced Observations:**
```python
# Add gripper-specific observations
gripper_state = ObsTerm(func=mdp.gripper_joint_state)
gripper_contact_forces = ObsTerm(func=mdp.gripper_contact_forces, params={"sensor_cfg": SceneEntityCfg("gripper_contact")})
```

**New Reward Terms:**
```python
# Add gripping rewards
gripper_contact = RewTerm(func=mdp.gripper_contact_reward, params={"contact_threshold": 0.1}, weight=3.0)
gripper_closing = RewTerm(func=mdp.gripper_closing_reward, params={"target_gripper_pos": 0.1}, weight=1.0)
successful_grasp = RewTerm(func=mdp.successful_grasp_reward, params={"gripper_threshold": 0.2, "contact_threshold": 0.1}, weight=5.0)
```

### 6. Improved PPO Configuration (`agents/skrl_ppo_cfg.yaml`)

**Enhanced Network Architecture:**
```yaml
layers: [512, 512, 256, 128]  # Deeper network for complex gripping task
```

**Better Training Parameters:**
```yaml
rollouts: 32  # Increased from 16 for better exploration
learning_epochs: 10  # Increased from 8 for better learning
mini_batches: 8  # Increased from 4 for better gradient estimates
learning_rate: 3.0e-04  # Slightly lower for stability
entropy_loss_scale: 0.005  # Increased from 0.001 for better exploration
```

## How to Use the Improvements

### 1. Test the Improvements

Run the test script to verify the improvements work:

```bash
python scripts/test_gripping.py
```

This will:
- Create the environment with all improvements
- Run a few episodes with random actions
- Show contact detection and grasping behavior
- Verify that the new rewards are being received

### 2. Train with the Improved Configuration

Use the existing training script with the improved configuration:

```bash
python scripts/skrl/train.py --task SO100-Cube-Lift-With-Camera-v0
```

The training will now use:
- Contact sensors for better feedback
- Continuous gripper control for finer manipulation
- Gripping-specific rewards to encourage proper behavior
- Enhanced observations for better policy learning
- Improved PPO hyperparameters for better training

### 3. Monitor Training Progress

During training, monitor these key metrics:

1. **Gripper Contact Reward** - Should increase as the robot learns to touch the object
2. **Successful Grasp Reward** - Should increase as the robot learns to properly grip
3. **Lifting Object Reward** - Should increase as the robot learns to lift after grasping
4. **Total Episode Reward** - Should show overall improvement

## Expected Behavior

With these improvements, the SO100 robot should now:

1. **Detect Contact**: Contact sensors provide feedback when the gripper touches the object
2. **Fine Gripper Control**: Continuous gripper actions allow for precise gripping
3. **Learn Gripping Behavior**: New reward functions encourage proper gripping sequences
4. **Stronger Grip**: Enhanced actuator parameters provide more reliable gripping force
5. **Better Feedback**: Additional observations help the policy understand gripper state and contact

## Training Recommendations

1. **Start with Contact Visualization**: Enable `debug_vis=True` for contact sensors to verify they're working
2. **Monitor Gripping Rewards**: Check that `gripper_contact` and `successful_grasp` rewards are being received
3. **Adjust Reward Weights**: Fine-tune the weights of gripping rewards based on training progress
4. **Increase Episode Length**: Consider extending episode length to allow more time for gripping and lifting
5. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easier object positions and gradually increase difficulty

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Contact Detection**: 
   - Verify contact sensors are enabled in robot config
   - Check that `debug_vis=True` shows contact visualization
   - Ensure gripper contact sensor is properly configured

2. **Weak Gripping**:
   - Increase gripper actuator effort_limit and stiffness
   - Adjust contact_threshold in reward functions
   - Check gripper joint limits and scaling

3. **Poor Training Performance**:
   - Increase network size and training timesteps
   - Adjust reward weights to balance different objectives
   - Consider curriculum learning for easier initial conditions

### Debugging Tips

1. **Visualize Contact**: Enable debug visualization to see when contact occurs
2. **Monitor Rewards**: Print individual reward components during training
3. **Check Observations**: Verify that gripper state and contact forces are being observed
4. **Test Actuators**: Run simple gripper open/close tests to verify actuator performance

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a comprehensive solution for enabling the SO100 robot to successfully grasp and lift the cube. The combination of contact sensors, continuous gripper control, gripping-specific rewards, and enhanced observations should significantly improve the robot's ability to perform the lifting task.

The key is that the robot now has:
- **Sensory feedback** from contact sensors
- **Fine control** over gripper actions
- **Clear rewards** for successful gripping behavior
- **Rich observations** to understand its state
- **Stronger actuators** for reliable gripping

With these improvements, the SO100 robot should be able to learn the complete sequence: reach → contact → grip → lift.
