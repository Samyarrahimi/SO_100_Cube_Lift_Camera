# SO100 Robot Arm Gripping and Lifting Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The SO100 robot arm was reaching the cube but not gripping and lifting it due to several key issues:

1. **No Contact Sensors**: Contact sensors were disabled, preventing the robot from detecting when it touches the object
2. **Binary Gripper Control**: The gripper used binary open/close actions, making fine control difficult
3. **Missing Gripping Rewards**: No specific rewards for successful gripping behavior
4. **Weak Gripper Actuator**: Insufficient force and stiffness for reliable gripping
5. **Limited Observations**: Policy lacked gripper state and contact information

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Robot Configuration (`so_100_robot_cfg.py`)

**Contact Sensors Enabled:**
```python
activate_contact_sensors=True  # Enable contact sensors for better gripping
```

**Improved Gripper Actuator:**
```python
"gripper": ImplicitActuatorCfg(
    joint_names_expr=["Gripper"],
    effort_limit=5.0,    # Increased from 3.0 for stronger grip
    velocity_limit_sim=2.0,  # Increased from 1.5 for faster gripping
    stiffness=100.0,    # Increased from 60.0 for more reliable closing
    damping=30.0,       # Increased from 20.0 for stability
),
```

### 2. Contact Sensor Integration (`so_100_cube_lift_with_camera_env_cfg.py`)

**Added Gripper Contact Sensor:**
```python
self.scene.gripper_contact = ContactSensorCfg(
    prim_path="{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Robot/Fixed_Gripper",
    body_names=["Fixed_Gripper"],
    history_length=5,
    track_pose=True,
    filter_prim_paths_expr=["{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Object"],
    debug_vis=True,
)
```

**Continuous Gripper Control:**
```python
# Changed from BinaryJointPositionActionCfg to JointPositionActionCfg
self.actions.gripper_action = mdp.JointPositionActionCfg(
    asset_name="robot",
    joint_names=["Gripper"],
    scale=0.3,  # Smaller scale for finer control
    use_default_offset=True
)
```

### 3. Enhanced Reward Functions (`mdp/rewards.py`)

**New Gripping Rewards:**

1. **Contact Detection Reward:**
```python
def gripper_contact_reward(env, contact_threshold=0.1):
    """Reward for detecting contact between gripper and object."""
```

2. **Gripper Closing Reward:**
```python
def gripper_closing_reward(env, target_gripper_pos=0.1):
    """Reward for closing the gripper when near the object."""
```

3. **Successful Grasp Reward:**
```python
def successful_grasp_reward(env, gripper_threshold=0.2, contact_threshold=0.1):
    """Combined reward for successful grasping (gripper closed + contact detected)."""
```

### 4. Improved Observations (`mdp/observations.py`)

**New Observation Functions:**

1. **Gripper State:**
```python
def gripper_joint_state(env):
    """Get the current gripper joint state."""
```

2. **Contact Forces:**
```python
def gripper_contact_forces(env, sensor_cfg):
    """Get contact forces from the gripper contact sensor."""
```

### 5. Updated Environment Configuration (`so_100_base_env_cfg.py`)

**Enhanced Observations:**
```python
# Add gripper-specific observations
gripper_state = ObsTerm(func=mdp.gripper_joint_state)
gripper_contact_forces = ObsTerm(func=mdp.gripper_contact_forces, params={"sensor_cfg": SceneEntityCfg("gripper_contact")})
```

**New Reward Terms:**
```python
# Add gripping rewards
gripper_contact = RewTerm(func=mdp.gripper_contact_reward, params={"contact_threshold": 0.1}, weight=3.0)
gripper_closing = RewTerm(func=mdp.gripper_closing_reward, params={"target_gripper_pos": 0.1}, weight=1.0)
successful_grasp = RewTerm(func=mdp.successful_grasp_reward, params={"gripper_threshold": 0.2, "contact_threshold": 0.1}, weight=5.0)
```

### 6. Improved PPO Configuration (`agents/skrl_ppo_cfg.yaml`)

**Enhanced Network Architecture:**
```yaml
layers: [512, 512, 256, 128]  # Deeper network for complex gripping task
```

**Better Training Parameters:**
```yaml
rollouts: 32  # Increased from 16 for better exploration
learning_epochs: 10  # Increased from 8 for better learning
mini_batches: 8  # Increased from 4 for better gradient estimates
learning_rate: 3.0e-04  # Slightly lower for stability
entropy_loss_scale: 0.005  # Increased from 0.001 for better exploration
timesteps: 200000  # Increased from 110000 for better learning
```

## Expected Improvements

With these changes, the SO100 robot arm should now:

1. **Detect Contact**: Contact sensors will provide feedback when the gripper touches the object
2. **Fine Gripper Control**: Continuous gripper actions allow for precise gripping
3. **Learn Gripping Behavior**: New reward functions encourage proper gripping sequences
4. **Stronger Grip**: Enhanced actuator parameters provide more reliable gripping force
5. **Better Feedback**: Additional observations help the policy understand gripper state and contact

## Training Recommendations

1. **Start with Contact Visualization**: Enable `debug_vis=True` for contact sensors to verify they're working
2. **Monitor Gripping Rewards**: Check that `gripper_contact` and `successful_grasp` rewards are being received
3. **Adjust Reward Weights**: Fine-tune the weights of gripping rewards based on training progress
4. **Increase Episode Length**: Consider extending episode length to allow more time for gripping and lifting
5. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easier object positions and gradually increase difficulty

## Key Files Modified

- `so_100_robot_cfg.py` - Enhanced gripper actuator and enabled contact sensors
- `so_100_cube_lift_with_camera_env_cfg.py` - Added contact sensor and continuous gripper control
- `mdp/rewards.py` - Added gripping-specific reward functions
- `mdp/observations.py` - Added gripper state and contact force observations
- `so_100_base_env_cfg.py` - Integrated new observations and rewards
- `agents/skrl_ppo_cfg.yaml` - Improved PPO hyperparameters and network architecture

These improvements should significantly enhance the robot's ability to successfully grip and lift the cube.
